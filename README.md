# OCP3-on-AWS-GovCloud
Deploy Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform 3 in AWS GovCloud

Status:  Just started.  Don't expect anything cool yet.

## Overview
This Repo will chronical my experience with:
* Onboarding - GovCloud (MFA, IAM user, Access Keys)
* Research - OpenShift Container Platform 3 on AWS (which is a commerical/public cloud initiative)
* Design and Architecture Overview
* Artifacts and IaC  - to deploy the solution
* Deployment and Provisioning 
* Account Limits - configuring constraints/limits in my account (billing)
* Teardown - decommision the solution (to save $$)

## Onboarding - Signup for GovCloud
Contrary to popular belief you don't need to be a "Goverment" to get a GovCloud account.  There *are* some additional hoops you have to jump through, but the process is fairly easy and straight-forward.

[Sign Up for GovCloud](GovCloud-Signup.md)  
WARNING:  AWS recommends, and I concur, that you setup a new AWS account dedicated to your GovCloud endevours.

## Research - OpenShift 3 on AWS

## Design and Architecture Overview


## Deployment and Provisioning 
I am going to use Terraform for this (I think...)  I am not familiar and I need to shift my focus away from my AWS experience to a more cloud-neutral approach.

## Account Limits 

## Unfold the sheet of paper


## References
I am going to create a separate doc for the references
