# OCP3-on-AWS-GovCloud
Deploy Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform 3 in AWS GovCloud

*Status:*  Just started.  Don't expect anything cool yet.

## Overview
This Repo will chronical my experience with:
* onboarding myself to GovCloud
* reseraching OpenShift Container Platform 3 on AWS (which is a commerical/public cloud initiative)
* Architecting and documenting my deployment
* creating the artifact and IaC to deploy the solution
* deploying the solution
* configuring constraints in my account (billing)
* tearing the solution down

## Signup for GovCloud
Contrary to popular belief you don't need to be a "Goverment" to get a GovCloud account.  There *are* some additional hoops you have to jump through, but the process is fairly easy and straight-forward.

[Sign Up for GovCloud](GovCloud-Signup.md)
WARNING:  AWS recommends, and I concur, that you setup a new AWS account dedicated to your GovCloud endevours.

## Prepare for your deployment
I am going to use Terraform for this (I think...)  I am not familiar and I need to shift my focus away from my AWS experience to a more cloud-neutral approach.

## References
I am going to create a separate doc for the references
